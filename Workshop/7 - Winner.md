## Winner

But, WAIT, who won ? who loose ?

`GameOver` scene just shows the point they both have when one of them loose.

We might want to show who actually won here 😁

The original goal of the **Tron** game is to trap the other snake to crash on yourself or a wall.

To reflect that behaviour as a success we could, (you can do it differently) :

- On the `GameOver` scene write “Snake/Ekans is the winner” instead of “game over”
- Reset the looser points back to 0 when he loose - so the only way to keep your accumulated points would be to win.

Try implement that !
