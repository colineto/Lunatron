# "Hello, Indigo!"

![Screen grab of "Hello, Indigo!"](screenshot.png)

This is a small "hello, world"-like project to help people get started with indigo. There is a [write up](https://indigoengine.io/docs/quickstart/hello-indigo) if you'd like to follow along with how the this little demo was made.

> Note: The Mill version was built first, and it's [commit history](https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/hello-indigo) shows how the demo was built up.

This demo has been built using SBT, but you can use Mill, please see the [set up guide](https://indigoengine.io/docs/quickstart/setup-and-configuration).

Assuming you have [SBT](https://www.scala-sbt.org/) set up as the guide suggests, to run the demo, do the following from your command line:

```bash
sbt runGame
```
